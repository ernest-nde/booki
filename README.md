# JUST AN HTML & CSS Project
The following code is just a smal project whitch is include in Web Dev learning program on <code>openclassrooms.com</code> where I took almost all the knowledge I will use here.
So what you may juge or make a critique is my ability to apply :
- A good HTML or CSS good pratice,
- The fact to respect some of HTML coding skills (semantic, responsive design, documentation with comment, etc.),
